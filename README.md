Let's all share our system customizations

## Usage

This is meant to be a shared set of scripts for all of the engineers at Refinery29 to customize our development machines, so usage should includeâ€“at least awareness ofâ€“contribution to this repo. That said, basic usage of this repo can be as simple as:
```
git clone git@github.com:refinery29/devops-homedirs.git
cd devops-homedirs
./tswift.yml --extra-vars dotfiles_user=tswift
```
This will execute the *tswift.yml* playbook according to its hash bang line. In this repo, each playbook will have a hash bang line which will use `ansible-playbook` with *vagrant.local.rf29.net* specified for the inventory.  with the extra variable `dotfiles_user` set to `tswift`.

## Playbooks
The playbooks are where the logic for setting up machines is directed. I use the word "directed" because most of the logic is contained in the roles. The simplest playbooks in this repo could just consist of list of `roles`, but most will include some variablesâ€“specified as `vars`â€“and perhaps some additional logic in the form of `tasks` or even `pre_tasks`.

For example, the tswift playbook:
```
#!/usr/bin/env ansible-playbook --inventory vagrant.local.rf29.net,
---
# Each member of this list is a *play*, thus this is a *playbook*
- hosts: all
  vars:
    dotfiles:
    - zshrc
    - gitconfig
    - vimrc
  pre_tasks:
  - name: Kisses ðŸ’‹
    command: touch /var/ðŸ’‹
```

The hash bash line specifies use of ansible-playbook to execute this script with the inventory set to *vagrant.local.rf29.net* (the ',' is necessary as an inventory is usually more than one machine).
